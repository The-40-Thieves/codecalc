"""Screen every caller string before it reaches SymPy.

SymPy evaluates the expressions it parses. `parse_expr` does not leak builtins
by accident — it populates its default `global_dict` from `vars(builtins)` on
purpose, copying the builtin functions in, `__import__` among them. On sympy
1.14.0 that dictionary holds 967 names. `sympify` on a string routes through
the same parser.

So `simplify_expression("__import__('os').system('id')")` ran `id`. The
SympifyError raised afterwards is SymPy failing to convert the RETURN VALUE;
the call already happened. That trailing exception is why this reads as a
rejected input when it is not.

This is AUDIT.md CRITICAL-01 through a different door. That one was
`truth_table` calling `eval` with a restricted globals dict, and the lesson
written down then was that restricting names does not contain an evaluator,
because the escape uses the object graph rather than the namespace. The same
applies here: narrowing `global_dict` does not make an evaluator safe, it just
moves the search. Hence a screen on the INPUT, in the same spirit as the
recursive-descent `_BoolParser` that replaced that eval.

WHY TOKENS AND NOT `ast.parse`:
`_math_transforms()` enables `implicit_multiplication_application`, so SymPy
legitimately accepts `2x`, `sin x` and `x y` — none of which are valid Python.
Screening with `ast.parse` would reject expressions the tool is documented to
support. Tokenising checks the raw string against a closed grammar without
requiring it to be a Python expression.

WHAT IS REFUSED, and why each one:
  attribute access (`.`)   the class-tree walk and every `os.system` shape
  leading underscore       `__import__`, `__class__`, `__subclasses__`
  string literals          `__import__('os')` needs one; maths does not
  subscripts (`[`, `]`)    `.__subclasses__()[N]`
  statement syntax         `=`, `;`, `:`, `@`, walrus — an expression tool
                           has no use for them, and `lambda`/comprehensions
                           reintroduce arbitrary evaluation
Numbers keep their dots: `1.5` is a single NUMBER token, so refusing the `.`
OPERATOR does not refuse decimals. That is asserted in the tests rather than
assumed.

This is a screen, not a sandbox. It is deliberately a denylist of syntax
rather than an allowlist of names, because the names SymPy accepts are open
(every symbol a caller invents) while the syntax an attacker needs is small
and closed. If a bypass is found the answer is to stop passing caller strings
to an evaluator, not to widen this list.

UPSTREAM AGREES, AND HAS TRIED THIS:
That last sentence was written from first principles here. SymPy's own
maintainers reached it about their own attempt at the same thing. PR #12524
added a `safe=` flag to sympify() built on an AST whitelist plus a name
blacklist — structurally this module — and it was NEVER MERGED, abandoned
since 2020:

    "I am sure that someone malicious would be able to circumvent what we
     have here so I would still describe this as unsafe rather than
     'mostly safe'."                                     -- oscarbenjamin

    "security theater that leads users into a false sense of security,
     because it can still be bypassed"     -- asmeurer, the PR's own author

sympy/sympy#10805 ("sympify shouldn't use eval") is still open, and the fix
advocated there is a complete direct evaluator rather than any screening. So
this file should be read as buying time against the obvious attacks, not as a
boundary. Do not let its passing be mistaken for the input being safe.

Also verified against the pinned version rather than assumed: sympy 1.14.0's
sympify takes (a, locals, convert_xor, strict, rational, evaluate). There is
no `safe=` to pass — code written against that PR raises TypeError.

      3. A second, real parse — still through `safe_global_dict()`, never
         SymPy's default builtins-populated dict — only if step 2 passed and
         the caller wants the evaluated value.

      `safe_global_dict()` is what step 3 buys beyond step 1: a screened,
      non-denylisted NAME can still be a live Python builtin.
      `input`/`breakpoint`/`quit` carry none of classify_unsafe's denied
      syntax, so they pass step 1 — but SymPy's DEFAULT `global_dict` is
      `vars(builtins)` copied in, so a bare `sympify("input()")` would CALL
      the real `input()`, reading stdin (fd 0, shared with a stdio MCP
      server). `safe_global_dict()` has no Python builtins in it at all, so
      an undefined name parses to a harmless symbolic `Function` or a clean
      parse error instead of a live call.

    Three call sites doing this by hand is three chances for a fourth to do
    it differently — `exact.py`'s tools were the proof: each did
    `classify_unsafe` then a bare `sp.sympify`, skipping steps 2 and 3
    entirely. This is the anti-regression move: one entry point, so a future
    caller can't do classify_unsafe-but-forget-the-safe-parse.

    Returns `(value, None)` on success, or `(None, (category, message))` on
    failure — the SAME `(category, message)` shape `classify_unsafe` returns
    on its own, so a caller maps it to its own error code with
    `errors.code_for_safe_expr_category(category)` exactly as it already
    does for a bare `classify_unsafe` call. A parse-time exception and an
    explosive shape are reported as `CATEGORY_VALIDATION` /
    `CATEGORY_CEILING` respectively — the same two categories a caller
    already maps for classify_unsafe's own findings.

    `evaluate=False` returns the unevaluated shape from step 2 instead of
    doing step 3 — the caller wants the tree, not a value (matches the
    original `sp.sympify(raw, evaluate=False)` no-`=` path in
    `logic._solve_linear`).

    """Reason this PARSED expression must not be evaluated, or None.

    Takes the tree from `parse_expr(..., evaluate=False)`, which is cheap
    (1ms on a power tower) and, crucially, has not done the arithmetic yet.
    This is the half of the bound that the token screen cannot reach: `**` is
    an operator, so its cost is invisible until the operands are known.

    this is a FAST PATH for the power-tower shape, not a complete
    bound on every way an expression can be expensive — worth stating
    explicitly, because "the shape guard" is an easy thing for a future
    reader to over-trust. `9**9**9**9` and `2**100000` are caught here
    because their cost is invisible until AFTER a cheap, already-parsed tree
    is inspected: the danger is in the VALUE two operands produce, not in
    building the tree that holds them.

    Deeply nested parens combined with a long chain of repeated terms
    (`"("*130 + "1.5+2.3"*410 + ")"*130`, found by `scripts/fuzz.py`) is a
    DIFFERENT shape of expensive, and this function cannot bound it: the cost
    there is inside SymPy's own recursive-descent parser BUILDING the tree —
    it shows up as a caught `RecursionError` ("maximum recursion depth
    exceeded") that this function never gets a chance to inspect, because
    `safe_parse` only calls `reject_explosive` on a tree that `parse_expr`
    already finished constructing. A structural check here, however cheap,
    cannot bound work that happens before there is a tree to check.

    A pre-parse guard that estimated nesting depth x repeated-term count on
    the RAW STRING was considered instead, to bound the recursion before
    `parse_expr` ever runs. Measured, that interaction is noisy and
    superlinear in ways that don't reduce to a safe closed-form cap without
    either being toothless (too high to catch the slow cases) or rejecting
    ordinary expressions with a handful of legitimate nested parens — the
    same "denylist that has to anticipate everything" trade `guarded.py`'s
    own module docstring already rejected for the *evaluation* side, here on
    the *parsing* side instead.

    What actually bounds this shape is measured, not assumed: every caller of
    `safe_parse` (`evaluate_expression`, `algebraic_equiv`, `solve_expression`,
    `limit_expression`, `simplify_expression`, `matrix`, `solve_linear`) runs
    it through `guarded.guarded_call`, which enforces `RLIMIT_CPU` (10s) on
    the forked child and a 15s wall-clock in the parent regardless — and the
    2000-char `_MAX_EXPR_LEN` every one of those callers already enforces
    before a string reaches here keeps the worst measured cost at this shape
    (~5.3s, `scripts/fuzz.py --seed 777`) comfortably under both. Past that
    length cap the same shape gets worse without an obvious ceiling
    (`scripts/fuzz.py`'s module docstring measured 3.5s at roughly 2x the
    length with no sign of levelling off) — which is exactly why every caller
    keeps the length cap AND the guarded_call backstop, rather than treating
    either alone as sufficient. See `tests/test_bug_sweep.py`'s block
    for the assertion that the backstop actually holds for this shape.
