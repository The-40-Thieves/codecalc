"""Screen every caller string before it reaches SymPy.

SymPy evaluates the expressions it parses. `parse_expr` does not leak builtins
by accident — it populates its default `global_dict` from `vars(builtins)` on
purpose, copying the builtin functions in, `__import__` among them. On sympy
1.14.0 that dictionary holds 967 names. `sympify` on a string routes through
the same parser.

So `simplify_expression("__import__('os').system('id')")` ran `id`. The
SympifyError raised afterwards is SymPy failing to convert the RETURN VALUE;
the call already happened. That trailing exception is why this reads as a
rejected input when it is not.

This is AUDIT.md CRITICAL-01 through a different door. That one was
`truth_table` calling `eval` with a restricted globals dict, and the lesson
written down then was that restricting names does not contain an evaluator,
because the escape uses the object graph rather than the namespace. The same
applies here: narrowing `global_dict` does not make an evaluator safe, it just
moves the search. Hence a screen on the INPUT, in the same spirit as the
recursive-descent `_BoolParser` that replaced that eval.

WHY TOKENS AND NOT `ast.parse`:
`_math_transforms()` enables `implicit_multiplication_application`, so SymPy
legitimately accepts `2x`, `sin x` and `x y` — none of which are valid Python.
Screening with `ast.parse` would reject expressions the tool is documented to
support. Tokenising checks the raw string against a closed grammar without
requiring it to be a Python expression.

WHAT IS REFUSED, and why each one:
  attribute access (`.`)   the class-tree walk and every `os.system` shape
  leading underscore       `__import__`, `__class__`, `__subclasses__`
  string literals          `__import__('os')` needs one; maths does not
  subscripts (`[`, `]`)    `.__subclasses__()[N]`
  statement syntax         `=`, `;`, `:`, `@`, walrus — an expression tool
                           has no use for them, and `lambda`/comprehensions
                           reintroduce arbitrary evaluation
Numbers keep their dots: `1.5` is a single NUMBER token, so refusing the `.`
OPERATOR does not refuse decimals. That is asserted in the tests rather than
assumed.

This is a screen, not a sandbox. It is deliberately a denylist of syntax
rather than an allowlist of names, because the names SymPy accepts are open
(every symbol a caller invents) while the syntax an attacker needs is small
and closed. If a bypass is found the answer is to stop passing caller strings
to an evaluator, not to widen this list.

UPSTREAM AGREES, AND HAS TRIED THIS:
That last sentence was written from first principles here. SymPy's own
maintainers reached it about their own attempt at the same thing. PR #12524
added a `safe=` flag to sympify() built on an AST whitelist plus a name
blacklist — structurally this module — and it was NEVER MERGED, abandoned
since 2020:

    "I am sure that someone malicious would be able to circumvent what we
     have here so I would still describe this as unsafe rather than
     'mostly safe'."                                     -- oscarbenjamin

    "security theater that leads users into a false sense of security,
     because it can still be bypassed"     -- asmeurer, the PR's own author

sympy/sympy#10805 ("sympify shouldn't use eval") is still open, and the fix
advocated there is a complete direct evaluator rather than any screening. So
this file should be read as buying time against the obvious attacks, not as a
boundary. Do not let its passing be mistaken for the input being safe.

Also verified against the pinned version rather than assumed: sympy 1.14.0's
sympify takes (a, locals, convert_xor, strict, rational, evaluate). There is
no `safe=` to pass — code written against that PR raises TypeError.

#: suppresses OPERATOR evaluation — `9**9**9**9` stays an unevaluated Pow tree
